# üè† AI-Powered Traffic Management System.
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Work in Progress

This project is currently an ongoing development and currently visible for demonstration purposes only. Further documentation
    and bug fixing will be provided as the project expands and features are implemented. It is worth noting that the data produced is heavily 
    dependant on the video being processed due to model limitations and other comptuer vision specific hardships that come with random video inputs. 

CURRENTLY, THIS IMPLEMENTATION FOCUSES ON TWO SEPARATE MODELS:

    1 -> VEHICLE DETECTION.
    2 -> PLATE DETECTION.

THIS COMES WITH CERTAIN DIFFICULTIES AND IS CURRENTLY SHELVED, MEANING MANY BUGS ARE CURRENTLY PRESENT.

## Overview

Embracing the future of AI, automating processes that directly impact our daily lives -- like traffic management. This system is to demonstrate how a
simple implementation can be used to enhance road safety and efficiency whilst providing data driven insights. 

By leveraging deep learning techniques to monitor and manage traffic in real time through the integration of an object detection model from Ultralytics, detecting vehicles of interest, tracks their movement and estimates their speeds. With this implementation, roads can be made safer by handling negligent road users and handling them accordingly.

    ### Key Benefits:

        * Enhanced Road Safety: Quickly identify offenders violating trafic laws to enable proactive interventions.
        * Automation: Monitoring process is now automated to alleviate the need for manaul, human driven, oversight.
        * Data-Driven Insights: Returns detailed analytics on traffic which can help lead to better informed decision making.

# üîß Prerequisites

    * In order for this project to be viable, these components are required. 

    ### Hardware:

        * Devices with CUDA comptabible GPUs are favoured. Application should be viable on most devices however
            performance will be staggered, unable to leverage hardware acceleration.

    ### Software:

        * Python 3.11
        * Ultralytics YOLO V11 (https://www.ultralytics.com/yolo)
            - Current V11 model weights included, access site should there be model issues to access
                most up to date.
        * OpenCV
        * Numpy
